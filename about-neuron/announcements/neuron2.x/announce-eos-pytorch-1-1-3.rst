Announcing end of support for PyTorch 1.13 starting next release
----------------------------------------------------------------

:ref:`Neuron Release 2.21 <neuron-2.21.0-whatsnew>` is the last release to support PyTorch 1.13, its associated Deep Learning Containers (DLCs), and Deep Learning AMIs (DLAMIS) for Trn1, Trn2, and Inf2 instances.

We recommend that all customers using torch-neuron 1.13, related DLCs, and DLAMIS on Trn2, Trn1, and Inf2 instances upgrade to the latest supported PyTorch version. For more information on supported versions, please refer to :ref:`latest-neuron-release-artifacts`.

Please note that PyTorch 1.13 will continue to be supported for Inf1 instances.
