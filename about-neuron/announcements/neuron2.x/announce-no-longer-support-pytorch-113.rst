Neuron no longer supports PyTorch 1.13 starting this release
-------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with :ref:`Neuron Release 2.22 <neuron-2.22.0-whatsnew>`, Neuron no longer supports PyTorch 1.13, its associated Deep Learning Containers (DLCs), and Deep Learning AMIs (DLAMIS) for Trn1, Trn2, and Inf2 instances.

We recommend that all customers using PyTorch 1.13, related DLCs, and DLAMIS on Trn2, Trn1, and Inf2 instances upgrade to the latest supported PyTorch version. For more information on supported versions, please refer to :ref:`latest-neuron-release-artifacts`.

Please note that PyTorch 1.13 will continue to be supported for Inf1 instances.
