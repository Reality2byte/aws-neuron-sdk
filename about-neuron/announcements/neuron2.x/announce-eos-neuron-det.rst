Announcing end of support for Neuron DET tool starting next release
-------------------------------------------------------------------

:ref:`Neuron Release 2.21 <neuron-2.21.0-whatsnew>` will be the last release to support the Neuron Distributed Event Tracing (NDET/neuron-det) tool (:ref:`neuron-det-ug`).

We recommend all customers using the NDET tool for debugging runtime hangs/issues in large-scale settings transition to the Neuron Profiler 2.0. This tool offers the same runtime function level traces with improved ease of use and optimized performance. For more information on Neuron Profiler 2.0, please refer to the :ref:`neuron-profiler-2-0-guide`.
