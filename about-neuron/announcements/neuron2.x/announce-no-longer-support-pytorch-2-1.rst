Neuron no longer supports PyTorch 2.1 starting this release
------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with :ref:`Neuron Release 2.22 <neuron-2.22.0-whatsnew>`, Neuron no longer includes support for PyTorch 2.1, its associated Deep Learning Containers (DLCs), and Deep Learning AMIs (DLAMIS).

We recommend that all customers using PyTorch 2.1, related DLCs, and DLAMIS upgrade to the latest supported PyTorch version. For more information on supported versions, please refer to :ref:`latest-neuron-release-artifacts`.
