Announcing end of support for Python 3.8 in future releases
-----------------------------------------------------------

Due to Python 3.8 reaching its end-of-life status, future Neuron releases will no longer include support for this version.

=========================
How does this impact me?
=========================

I currently use Python 3.8.
============================

To avoid security issues and bugs, current users of Python 3.8 are advised to migrate to a Neuron supported Python version (3.9, 3.10, or 3.11) as Neuron will no longer support Python 3.8. For a list of supported Python versions according to Neuron package, please see :ref:`latest-neuron-release-artifacts`.

I currently use Ubuntu 20, which has Python 3.8 as the default version. Am I affected?
=======================================================================================

Although Python 3.8 is the default version of Ubuntu 20.04, Neuron will continue to support Ubuntu 20.04 until April 2025, due to extended standard support of Python 3.8 in Ubuntu 20. Please see the :ref:`sdk-maintenance-policy` for more information.
