Inferentia2 Architecture
------------------------

At the heart of each Inf2 instance are up to twelve Inferentia2 chips (each with two :ref:`NeuronCore-v2 <neuroncores-v2-arch>` cores). Inferentia2 is the second
generation AWS purpose-built Machine Learning inference accelerator. The Inferentia2 chip architecture is depicted below:

Each Inferentia2 chip consists of:
