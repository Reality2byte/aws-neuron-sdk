AWS NxD libraries
==================

Accelerate your machine learning workloads with Neuron's distributed libraries. Our libraries provide high-level abstractions and optimized implementations for distributed training and inference on AWS Trainium and Inferentia.

What are NeuronX Distributed libraries?
----------------------------------------

NeuronX Distributed (NxD) libraries are a comprehensive suite of PyTorch-based libraries designed to enable scalable machine learning on AWS Neuron hardware. The NxD ecosystem provides a layered architecture where foundational distributed primitives support higher-level training and inference workflows.

**The NxD Stack:**

* **NxD Core**: The foundational layer providing distributed primitives, model sharding techniques, and XLA-optimized implementations
* **NxD Training**: High-level training library built on NxD Core, offering turnkey distributed training workflows with NeMo compatibility
* **NxD Inference**: Production-ready inference library with advanced features like continuous batching, speculative decoding, and vLLM integration

Together, these libraries enable developers to scale from prototype to production while leveraging the full performance potential of AWS Trainium and Inferentia instances.
